We recommend using a newer Android Gradle plugin to use compileSdk = 35

This Android Gradle plugin (7.3.0) was tested up to compileSdk = 33

This warning can be suppressed by adding
    android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=35
to this project's gradle.properties

The build will continue, but you are strongly encouraged to update your project to
use a newer Android Gradle Plugin that has been tested with compileSdk = 35
